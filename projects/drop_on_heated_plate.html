        <h3>Simulation of Impact of Newtonian Liquid Drop on Heated Plate<br>- In Progress</h3>
      <div>
  
      <section class="page-body">
          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p>This project focuses on the simulation of the impact of a Newtonian liquid drop on a heated plate using OpenFOAM, a widely used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The study involves multiphase non-isothermal simulations of immiscible fluids with heat and mass transfer phenomena. The objective is to investigate the dynamic behavior and thermal characteristics of the liquid drop during impact on the heated surface.</p>

          <p>The simulation setup considers a two-phase system consisting of a liquid drop and a surrounding gas phase, which comprises air and the vapor of the fluid. The numerical model incorporates the Navier-Stokes equations, energy equation, and mass transfer equations using the Lee mass transfer model to capture the complex interfacial dynamics, heat transfer, and vaporization phenomena.</p>

          <p>By performing these simulations, we aim to gain insights into the intricate physics governing the impact process and understand the heat and mass transfer mechanisms associated with the system. The results will provide valuable information on the dynamics of liquid drop spreading, evaporation, vapor-phase behavior, and heat transfer, which can have significant implications in various real-life applications.</p>
